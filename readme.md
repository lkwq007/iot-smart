# IoT-Smart

IoT-Smart is a single-page application for Modern Mobile Communication Application System Experiment in Zhejiang University. In that course, controllers and sensors are deployed in a house-like IoT sandbox; they can communicate with the smart gateway ( a Cortex A9 tablet with Ubuntu ) using TI CC2530. The final project is implementing a cloud service to control the IoT sandbox via the smart gateway.
